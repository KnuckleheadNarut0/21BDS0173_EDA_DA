## **Introduction**

This project analyzes a diabetes dataset to uncover insights and patterns in the data. The workflow involves:
- Data Cleaning
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature Correlation
- Dimensionality Reduction using PCA

---

## **Dataset Description**

The dataset contains information about patients, including the following columns:

- **`Pregnancies`**: Number of times pregnant.
- **`Glucose`**: Plasma glucose concentration.
- **`BloodPressure`**: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg).
- **`SkinThickness`**: Triceps skinfold thickness (mm).
- **`Insulin`**: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml).
- **`BMI`**: Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2).
- **`DiabetesPedigreeFunction`**: Diabetes pedigree function.
- **`Age`**: Age of the person.
- **`Outcome`**: Diabetes classification (1 = Diabetic, 0 = Non-Diabetic).

---

## **Requirements**

Ensure you have the following libraries installed:

- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `scikit-learn`

---

## **Installation**

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git

	2.	Navigate to the project directory:

cd your-repo-name


	3.	Install required Python libraries:

pip install -r requirements.txt

How to Run the Code

	1.	Place the dataset file (diabetes.csv) in the project directory.
	2.	Open the notebook or script in a Python environment (e.g., Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab).
	3.	Update the file path in the script to point to your dataset:

file_path = "/path/to/diabetes.csv"


	4.	Run the code cells sequentially to perform the analysis.

Project Workflow

1. Data Cleaning

	•	Replaced missing or invalid values (?) with NaN.
	•	Converted columns to appropriate data types.
	•	Filled missing values with column means.

2. Univariate Analysis

	•	Histograms and boxplots were used to explore data distributions and detect outliers.

3. Bivariate Analysis

	•	Generated a correlation heatmap to identify feature relationships.
	•	Created a pairplot to visualize interactions among numeric features.

4. Multivariate Analysis

	•	Applied Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction.
	•	Visualized PCA components in a scatter plot.

Results

	•	Identified relationships between features affecting diabetes outcomes.
	•	Highlighted key patterns and distributions in the dataset.
	•	Reduced dimensions using PCA, emphasizing significant components.


### How to Use:
1. Replace placeholders like `yourusername`, `your-repo-name`, and `Your Name` with the appropriate details.
2. Save this as `README.md` in your project directory.
